        <p>This is an interesting but depressing book. </p>
<p>A key idea is that the concept of comparative advantage doesn’t apply to computers. The basis of comparative advantage is the concept of opportunity cost. But for machines, there is barely any opportunity cost - individual humans are unique, but machines, and especially software, can duplicate themselves at minimum costs. So it’s a winners take all world. </p>
<p>It’s also amazing to see the advancement in AI - machines can learn and adapt and have already shown early signs of curiosity and the ability to push on R&amp;D front. Even in the sphere of art, it’s not beyond discussion that humans are superior. The thing is, for humans to be a winner in today’s world, you need to be excessively good at one thing. Unfortunately, most people aren’t. We are trained to be generalist, but it seems that machines have much higher potential to be a great generalist than humans. </p>
<p>One scary fact is that in many cases, machines are already managing people. And empirical evidences suggest that machines generally beat people when it comes to managing a process. </p>
<p>One thing that I can think of that machine can’t beat human is in relationship management. When it comes to making people like you and feel a bond with you, machines can’t do that. Well… can they? In the movie - Her - the operating system is basically in romantic relationships with so many people. At least that scenario hasn’t materialized yet. Until then, the value of people management is really still there. The value of any professional expertise is valuable only to the extent that one is extremely good at certain area. </p>
<p>The book has a chapter each on higher education and health care. These are the two sectors in which automation has not made much inroads. They also happen to be the two sectors with the highest rate of  inflation relative to the rest of the economy over the last two decades. </p>
<p>The cost of higher education has risen much faster than general inflation. Research shows that the rising costs were not a result of higher cost of teaching. In fact, faculty has seen neither rapid employment nor wage growth. Instead, the increasing costs have been attributable to a) rising number of administrators providing various services to students, and b) the construction of luxurious student housing, sports and other facilities. Students’ parents have demonstrated high willingness to pay for such inflated prices for tickets to the “middle class”. Increasing availability of student loans have also been a big facilitator of education price inflations. </p>
<p>Chapter 6 gives a very good overview of why health costs have been very high. A few tidbits for me to take away:
- Medicare is probably the most efficient segment of healthcare services in the U.S. It covers about 90% of medical costs incurred. </p>
<ul>
<li>1% of population incurs 20% of total healthcare spending while the top 5% incurs 50% of total healthcare spending. Healthy people are heavily subsidizing the very sick. Young and middle classes are heavily subsidizing 65+ and poor people (Medicaid). </li>
<li>High hospital listing prices are preemptive strategy in negotiation with health care insurers. </li>
<li>So far, most technological advancement adopted by hospitals have increased the total cost of health care rather than lowering it through efficiency savings. Hospitals choose to adopt technologies that will increase their revenues. </li>
</ul>
<p>Another important idea is that workers are consumers, but computers are not. The replacement of machine for labor will ultimately lead to high level of income inequality and dwindling end consumer demand. </p>
<p><strong>My conclusion from all this is that the entire process is hugely deflationary. Insufficient demand coupled with declining costs of production could only means precipitously lower prices for mass consumer goods. This is already evident in the rise of TJ Max and Ross against traditional retailers. It also helps explains why massive QEs globally haven’t lead to spiral inflations as many have expected.</strong></p>
