        <p>For the last year or so, I have spent a lot more time investing in the A-share market. For someone who has been mainly investing in Chinese companies listed in the US and Hong Kong, entering the A-share market is like sailing from calm water into storms. This post is not a discussion about whether the A-share market is in a bubble or when the bubble is going to burst. Rather, I'm going to share what I have learned about the intricacies of this market through one single stock - CSR Corp (601766). </p>
<p><strong>CSR Stock Chart(1/1/2014-5/30/2015)</strong>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/63789657@N02/18284888039" title="OrchidCreek_CSR-stock-price by liuchengzhuan, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/478/18284888039_090bbac0db_z.jpg" width="541" height="428" alt="OrchidCreek_CSR-stock-price" width="600"></a></p>
<p>Here is a synoposis of my roller-coaster ride with the stock. </p>
<p>I first bought CSR in November and December 2013 at prices ranging between 5.19 and 5.48 Yuan per share. More was bought in late July 2014 at 5.19 Yuan per share, but it was still not a major position in the portfolio. In October, I did more research and decided to make it a bigger bet because:</p>
<ol>
<li>CSR is a solid company that manufactures products that I have been using intensively (riding the high speed rails back and forth between Beijing and Shanghai), </li>
<li>The prospects for the company to sell railway products globally is promising technologically and politically, and </li>
<li>The stock, at that time, was trading at mid-teens trailing p/e multiples. It was under-valued relative to its growth prospects. </li>
</ol>
<p>Just as I was ready to take the plunge, the company announced a trading halt due to "major restructuring" on October 27, 2014. But nobody knew how long the trading halt would be. Well, it turned out to be two whole months. A merger with CNR was announced in December, creating a monopoly of railway equipment manufacturing in China, and the stock resumed trading on December 31, 2014. To my dismay, the only thing I could do was to watch the stock price surging from 5.81 to 10.27 within six trading days while not being able to buy any at "market" prices. <em>It is not a market price when you can't buy it at that price.</em> </p>
<p>Here's is why. A-share market has a daily 10% price change limit rule, i.e., the price movement in a single day cannot exceed 10% of the previous day's closing price, either up or down. I don't know for sure why this rule came into being, although I suspect it's the securities regulator playing its paternalistic protective role again. This arbitrary limit of market price movement is a big disruption to market continuity and liquidity. In the case of CSR, even though I was willing to pay 7 Yuan a share, the stock stopped trading once it hits 6.39 (10% increase from the previous closing price) on December 31. CSR hit the 10% limit for six consecutive trading days until the price reached 10.27 on January 9, 2015. But then, the stock was not cheap any more. As a disciplined value investor, I couldn't bring myself to buy more at this price. </p>
<p>Fast forward to April, CSR went through another nine days of rapid price ascent, with eight out of those nine days seeing price hitting the 10% up limit. I started selling when price hit 20 Yuan. But a wise investor told me never to sell on a 10% up day. From decades of experience investing in the A-share market, she concludes that the probability of prices going up on the next day is much higher than going down when a stock hits a 10% up limit. "Sell when the limit streak is broken and trading volume picks up," she said. </p>
<p>This trading strategy makes sense because when a stock hits the 10% price increase limit with minimum trading volume, it probably means there isn't enough ready sellers at the prevailing limit price. Buyers should get ready to pay more. While this logic is not bullet proof, the belief can be self-fulfilling. Few would sell on a 10% up day if they believe they could always sell at a higher price on the next day. This crazy 10%-a-day ascent continued until the stock hit 39 on April 20, after which the stock started trading down in an extremely volatile pattern. I sold all CSR at prices ranging between 35 and 39. So for losses from not being able to buy as much CSR as I wanted to, I made it back from price overshoots, possibly also thanks to the 10% limit rule. </p>
<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trade decisively when you identify a good stock. Gradual accumulation only works in a continuous market. </li>
<li>Have an extremely concentrated portfolio can lead to large liquidty risks. Trading halts can last for months. This, combined with the 10% price change limit rule, means liquidity risks of A-share stocks are substantially higher than most US stocks. </li>
<li>10% price change limit rules often lead to price overshoots. Take advantage of it. But be aware of the associated liquidity risks, especially when everyone is trying to sell. </li>
